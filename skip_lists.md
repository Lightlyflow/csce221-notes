## Skip Lists Ops
| Variable | Average | Worst Case
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space Taken | $O(n)$ | |   
| Search | $O(\log n)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Insertion | $O(\log n)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Deletion | $O(\log n)$ | $O(n)$ |

### Notes
> Faster on average than singly linked list but uses more memory

> Expected operation runtimes can be proven using probability
